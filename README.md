# SQL-Project--Consumer-Goods-Ad-hoc-Insights

üöÄ A SQL case study project based on AtliQ Hardwares, a leading computer hardware company. The project simulates a real-world SQL challenge designed to provide business insights for management decision-making. It covers:  Writing optimized SQL queries for ad-hoc business requests,  generating reports for sales, finance, and customer insights,  practicing data analysis using realistic datasets, and  strengthening both 
technical (SQL) and analytical problem-solving skills.  This project is inspired by an industry-style analytics challenge, focusing on turning raw data into actionable insights.
